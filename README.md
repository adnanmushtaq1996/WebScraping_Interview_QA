# Machine Learning Ideas
Some possible idea with respect to this exercise :
1. With the Data collected for one website, we know the price is constantly changing.
2. With this era of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, we can create powerful models, that will help the customer to know, what the price is now, 
and what can be the possible price after certain days.
3. This allows customer to take a more informed decision.
